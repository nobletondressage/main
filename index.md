We feel that Seala has all the ingredients to go to the upper levels. She is forward and sensitive, but very level - headed. She has the expressive movement from the harness horse, without the "up and down" quality that can be a problem with extensions and ground cover. She truly represents the best of both worlds : expressive, elastic movement, with the brain and work ethic that is typical of the driving breeds. Seala would be suitable for an adult amateur, she has no buck, bolt or rear. She is currently barefoot, and has great feet and no health or soundness issues.

Not just the most petite riders look great on Erania, the rider in the video is 5"7. Erania has an excellent show record at training and first level, and will be showing fourth level this spring, with PSG on the horizon for the end of the summer.
   Although she has the brain for any level of rider (she was successfully and safety ridden and competed by a Para rider), she would be perfect for an amateur or professional rider with upper level aspirations. Her flying changes are super easy, big and expressive. Her extended gaits cover an incredible amount of ground, she has the biggest extended canter in the barn! She also shows a clear ability to collect in all three gaits, her powerful hind leg and free shoulder makes the work easy for her.
   Most importantly, Erania has a temperament that is unsurpassed. She is very forward and light off the leg, without being hot, tense or spooky. Erania is very brave in new environments, she hacks safely alone or in a group, and has absolutely no health or soundness issues. We truly feel that Grand Prix is in her future, she has the engine, work ethic and trainability to go all the way. She is a super horse, and we are looking for a special home for her!
